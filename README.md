# üóûÔ∏è User Engagement, Cadence & Category Intelligence System

### Overview
This system powers **A local newspaper's audience segmentation and engagement analytics**, unifying behavioral, subscription, and content-consumption data into actionable cohorts for marketing, editorial, and product teams.

It identifies **how users engage (depth + frequency)**, **who they are (subscribed/new)**, and **what they love (category focus)** ‚Äî producing a single, human-readable profile for each user.

## üß© Core Inputs

| Source | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **`eng_df`** | Base weekly user-level engagement data (visits, actions, durations). |
| **`merged`** | Enriched data with Subscription & New Account fields. |
| **`dfu`** | 8-week rolling user baseline ‚Äî engagement intensity & depth benchmark. |
| **`cad`** | Cadence labeling table (rhythm, gaps, and newness). |
| **`cats`** | Category analytics ‚Äî time spent and focus indicators by content section. |

All scripts run in **Google Colab** and output cleaned `.xlsx` reports into `/content/cleaned/`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Processing Pipeline

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Engagement Scoring  
- Cleans raw durations via **MAD-based repair** to remove inflated time.  
- Builds a weighted **Engagement Score** from:
  - Actions per visit  
  - Average visit duration (after repair)  
  - Visit frequency  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ 8-Week User Baseline  
- Aggregates metrics over each user‚Äôs **last 8 active weeks**.  
- Captures engagement medians and visit-weighted means.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Benchmarking (Depth)  
- Computes **Depth Band** relative to peers (`High / Good / Light / Quick Scan`).  
- Depth measures *content absorption per session*.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Cadence Labeling  
- Uses **AvgDaysBetween**, **WeeksActive**, and **Visits** to classify rhythm:  
  `Daily`, `Weekly`, `Biweekly`, `Sporadic`, `Binge`, `Inactive`.  
- Integrates **‚ÄúNew Accounts‚Äù** info to tag:  
  - `Fresh Joiners (<7d)`  
  - `Rising Newbies (8‚Äì20d)`

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Category Intelligence üóûÔ∏è  
- Each user‚Äôs **category split** (e.g., Politics, Economy, Culture, Sports) is analyzed to identify:  
  - **Favorite Category** ‚Üí where the user spends most time.  
  - **Time Spent per Category** ‚Üí normalized as a share of total reading time.  
  - **Focus Index** ‚Üí how concentrated vs. exploratory their reading behavior is.  
    - *Focused:* ‚â•70% of time in 1‚Äì2 categories.  
    - *Exploratory:* evenly distributed across many sections.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Unified User Summary  
- Merges all layers:  
  **Depth + Cadence + Subscription + Newness + Category Affinity**  
- Produces one flat record per user, ready for dashboards and CRM audiences.

## üß† Cohort Model (9 Segments)

| # | Cohort | Definition | Typical Marketing Focus |
|---|---------|-------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | **Fresh Joiners (<7d)** | New accounts, first-week readers. | Welcome/onboarding flows. |
| 2 | **Rising Newbies (8‚Äì20d)** | New users starting to return. | Nurture habit formation. |
| 3 | **Core Loyalists** | Subscribers with **high depth + high cadence**. | Retain & reward. |
| 4 | **Deep Periodic Readers** | Subscribers with **high depth** but visit less frequently. | Weekend content, curated newsletters. |
| 5 | **Active Skimmers** | Subscribers with **low depth + high cadence**. | Short-form, highlight-driven campaigns. |
| 6 | **At-Risk Subscribers** | Subscribers with **low depth + low cadence**. | Reactivation, renewal nudges. |
| 7 | **High-Potential Non-Subs** | Non-subs with **high depth + high cadence**. | Paywall & conversion offers. |
| 8 | **Exploring Non-Subs** | Non-subs with **high cadence**, **low depth**. | Deepen content engagement. |
| 9 | **Dormant / Lapsed** | Very low depth & cadence; inactive. | Win-back campaigns. |
